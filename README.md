**********CHANGE YOUR STRATEGEM TO ARROW KEYS AND LEFT CTRL IS SET TO HOLD IN KEY BINDINGS**********

I have been working on a Hell Divers 2 Voice attack since I started playing the game. All I will say for now is just say what you want in Voice Attack after you import the profile. I have everything updated up to the Mech strategems.

Brief tutorial: Say call, call in a, call in, call down, I need, I need a, i need an, request, requesting, ses, support, ship, (Strategem name) or just the name of the strategem in various shortened ways of saying it. just paractice a line until it becomes natural to you.

I have most support strategems including mission call downs like drills and upload data missions for example.

There are some small ones like weapon 1-4 and saying things like OH SHIT!!!! will make you dive. Stims (I need a stim) are also a command as well.

I have have been slowly adding more to this overtime so any suggestions are appreciated.

I would like to work on this more but have been too busy playing this game spreading democracy and make it more official. I hope you understand. I will keep it updated as I go.
